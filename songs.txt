one day
Matisyahu
2010-2-10
sometimes I lay
under the moon
and thank God I'm breathing
then I pray
don't take me soon
cause I'm here for a reason
sometimes in my tears I drown
but I never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around
because
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6
it's not about
win or lose
we all lose
when they feed on the souls of the innocent
blood drenched pavement
keep on moving thougn the waters stay raging
in this maze you can lose your way(your way)
it might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you no way(no way)
sometimes in my tears I drown
but I never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around
because
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6
one day this all will change
treat people the same
stop with the violence
down with the hate
one day we'll all the free
and proud to be
under the same sun
singing songs of freedom like
one day +4
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6
