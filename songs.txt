 No.1 One Day
 by Matisyahu
 2010-2-10
sometimes I lay
under the moon
and thank God I'm breathing
then I pray
don't take me soon
cause I'm here for a reason
sometimes in my tears I drown
but I never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around
because
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6
it's not about
win or lose
we all lose
when they feed on the souls of the innocent
blood drenched pavement
keep on moving thougn the waters stay raging
in this maze you can lose your way(your way)
it might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you no way(no way)
sometimes in my tears I drown
but I never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around
because
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6
one day this all will change
treat people the same
stop with the violence
down with the hate
one day we'll all the free
and proud to be
under the same sun
singing songs of freedom like
one day +4
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6

 No.2 Carry You Home
 by James Blunt
Trouble is her only friend and he's back again
Makes her body older than it really is
And she says it's high time she went away
No one's got much to say in this town
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
For the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
If she had wings she would fly away
And another day god will give her some
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breahing
for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
And they're all born pretty
in New York City tonight
and someone's little girl
was taken from the world to light under the Stars and Striples
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what is means
And I'll carry you home
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

 No.3 When I Find Love Again
 by James Blunt
Hey oh
Where can I go, When all the roads I take they never lead me home
Hey oh
I miss you so, but I'm used to seeing people come and go
Yeah, I've made mistakes
Next time, I swear I'll change
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll be much better than the man I used to be
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll have a better plan for us
Hey oh
Don't be afraid, cause you're only get stronger from the pain
Yeah I've made mistakes
Next time, I swear I'll change
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll be much better than the man I used to be
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll have a better plan for us
Yeah, you and me

Yeah, I've made mistakes
Next time, I swear I'll change
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll be much better than the man I used to be
When I find love again, when I find love again

Yeah, you and me
When I find love again, when I find love again

When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll be much better than the man I used to be
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll have a better plan for us

 No.4 Let The Music Heal Your Soul
 by Backstreet Boys
Oh if someone writes a song
With a simple sound
Just a song, where his feelings show
And if someone feels the same
About that simple song
Oh, sometimes, you can hear them say
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, it also heals your soul

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain

Oh, if someone plays piano
With some simple chords
So melodic, and endearing too...
I know if someone plays guitar
With the old piano
And maybe, you can hear them sing
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, also heals your soul

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain
oh yes...
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul
oohhh, oh yes...

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
(int your soul...)
Let the music heal your soul
(heal your soul...)
Let the music take control
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul
(yeeeeahhh...)
Let the music take control
Oh yes...
Let the music heal your soul
Everybody sing...

Let the music take control
(Let the music take control)
Let the music heal your soul
Let it heal your soul...
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control...

 No.5 When We Stand Together
 by Nickelback
One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win

They tell us everying's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night?
When something's clearly wrong
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win

The right thing to guide us
Is right here, inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartheat
The drum beat carries on...

And the drum beat carries on...

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
