 No.1 One Day
 by Matisyahu
 2010-2-10
sometimes I lay
under the moon
and thank God I'm breathing
then I pray
don't take me soon
cause I'm here for a reason
sometimes in my tears I drown
but I never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around
because
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6
it's not about
win or lose
we all lose
when they feed on the souls of the innocent
blood drenched pavement
keep on moving thougn the waters stay raging
in this maze you can lose your way(your way)
it might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you no way(no way)
sometimes in my tears I drown
but I never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around
because
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6
one day this all will change
treat people the same
stop with the violence
down with the hate
one day we'll all the free
and proud to be
under the same sun
singing songs of freedom like
one day +4
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6

 No.2 Carry You Home
 by James Blunt
Trouble is her only friend and he's back again
Makes her body older than it really is
And she says it's high time she went away
No one's got much to say in this town
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
For the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
If she had wings she would fly away
And another day god will give her some
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breahing
for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
And they're all born pretty
in New York City tonight
and someone's little girl
was taken from the world to light under the Stars and Striples
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what is means
And I'll carry you home
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

 No.4 Let The Music Heal Your Soul
 by Backstreet Boys
Oh if someone writes a song
With a simple sound
Just a song, where his feelings show
And if someone feels the same
About that simple song
Oh, sometimes, you can hear them say
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, it also heals your soul

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain

Oh, if someone plays piano
With some simple chords
So melodic, and endearing too...
I know if someone plays guitar
With the old piano
And maybe, you can hear them sing
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, also heals your soul

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain
oh yes...
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul
oohhh, oh yes...

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
(int your soul...)
Let the music heal your soul
(heal your soul...)
Let the music take control
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul
(yeeeeahhh...)
Let the music take control
Oh yes...
Let the music heal your soul
Everybody sing...

Let the music take control
(Let the music take control)
Let the music heal your soul
Let it heal your soul...
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control...

 No.5 When We Stand Together
 by Nickelback
One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win

They tell us everying's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night?
When something's clearly wrong
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win

The right thing to guide us
Is right here, inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartheat
The drum beat carries on...

And the drum beat carries on...

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win

 No.6 Demons 
 by Imagine Dragons
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale
I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made
Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
They say it’s what you make
I say it’s up to fate
It’s woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can’t escape this now
Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

 No.7 See you again
 for Paul Walker
 by Wiz Khalifa, Charlie Puth
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn who knew all the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here
Talking to you about another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place
Now I see you in a better place
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong and what's small turn to a friendship a friendship 
Turn into a bond and that bond will never Be broke and the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first then the line
Will never be crossed established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what
We reach so remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
Let the light guide your way
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take will always lead you home
Hoo~
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Again
When I see you again see you again
When I see you again
