 No.1 One Day
 by Matisyahu
 2010-2-10
sometimes I lay
under the moon
and thank God I'm breathing
then I pray
don't take me soon
cause I'm here for a reason
sometimes in my tears I drown
but I never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around
because
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6
it's not about
win or lose
we all lose
when they feed on the souls of the innocent
blood drenched pavement
keep on moving thougn the waters stay raging
in this maze you can lose your way(your way)
it might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you no way(no way)
sometimes in my tears I drown
but I never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around
because
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6
one day this all will change
treat people the same
stop with the violence
down with the hate
one day we'll all the free
and proud to be
under the same sun
singing songs of freedom like
one day +4
all my live I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
for the people to say
that we don't wanna fight no more
there'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day +6

 No.2 Carry You Home
 by James Blunt
Trouble is her only friend and he's back again
Makes her body older than it really is
And she says it's high time she went away
No one's got much to say in this town
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
For the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
If she had wings she would fly away
And another day god will give her some
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breahing
for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
And they're all born pretty
in New York City tonight
and someone's little girl
was taken from the world to light under the Stars and Striples
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what is means
And I'll carry you home
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

 No.4 Let The Music Heal Your Soul
 by Backstreet Boys
Oh if someone writes a song
With a simple sound
Just a song, where his feelings show
And if someone feels the same
About that simple song
Oh, sometimes, you can hear them say
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, it also heals your soul

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain

Oh, if someone plays piano
With some simple chords
So melodic, and endearing too...
I know if someone plays guitar
With the old piano
And maybe, you can hear them sing
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, also heals your soul

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain
oh yes...
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul
oohhh, oh yes...

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
(int your soul...)
Let the music heal your soul
(heal your soul...)
Let the music take control
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul
(yeeeeahhh...)
Let the music take control
Oh yes...
Let the music heal your soul
Everybody sing...

Let the music take control
(Let the music take control)
Let the music heal your soul
Let it heal your soul...
Let the music take control
Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control...

 No.5 When We Stand Together
 by Nickelback
One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win

They tell us everying's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night?
When something's clearly wrong
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win

The right thing to guide us
Is right here, inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartheat
The drum beat carries on...

And the drum beat carries on...

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win

 No.6 Demons 
 by Imagine Dragons
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale
I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made
Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
They say it’s what you make
I say it’s up to fate
It’s woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can’t escape this now
Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

 by Carly Rae Jepsen, Owl City
Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
Because it's always a good time
Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
Because it's always a good time
Good morning and good night
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
Feet down dropped my phone in the pool again
Checked out of my room hit the ATM
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
Because it's always a good time
Good morning and good night
I wake up attwilight
It's gonna be alright
we don't even have to try
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh woah-oh-oh-oh

Woah-oh-oh-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time.

 No.9 Centuries
 by Fall Out Boy
Du du du du-du du du
Du du du du du-du du du
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
Mollify my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story's all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me 
Remeber me, for centuries
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
And I can't stop till the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Just on mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
We've been here forever
And here's the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Just one mistake
Is all it take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries

 No. 10 Summer Train
 by Greyson Chance

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadowss passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
We've been awake all night, shattered dreams all around
Close your sad, sad eyes we will be safe and sound
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreaming lightly througn the rain
All's forgiven on a summer train
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Seems we are a thousand miles away from last night
As you sigh in my ear, kiss the rain goodbye
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreaming lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on a summer train
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right just breathe
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right you'll see
And the windowsare crying but this train is flying us all through the tain, I fear
And the sky is getting brighter with every mile
And it all seems clear
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreaming lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on a summer train
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right just breathe
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right you'll see
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right just breathe
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right you'll see
Come away with me

 No. 11 Take Me To Your Heart
 by Michael Learns To Rock
Hiding from the rain and snow
Trying to forget but I won't let go
Looking at a crowed street
Listening to my own heart beat
So many people all around the world
Tell me where do I find someone like you girl
Take me to your heart take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true
They say nothing lasts forever
We're only here today
Love is now or never
Bring me far away
Take me to your heart take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is be my guiding star
It's easy take me to your heart
Standing on a mountain high
Looking at the moon througn a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend
Don't need too much talking without saying anthing
All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing
Take me to your heart take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true
They say nothing lasts forever
We're only here today
Love is now or never
Bring me far away
Take me to your heart take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is be my guiding star
It's eary take me to your heart
Take me to your heart take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is be my guiding star
It's easy take me to your heart

No.12 If Everyone Cared
From underneath the trees, we watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight
Singing Amen, I'm alive
Singing Amen, I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
We'd see the day when nobody died
And I'm singing
Amen I..., I'm alive
Amen I..., I'm alive

And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
Singing Amen I'm alive
Singing Amen I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
We'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
We'd see the day when nobody died

And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
We'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
We'd see the day when nobody died
We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day when nobody died

No. 13 Impossible
by Shontelle
I rememner years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did
And now When all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof top
Write it on the sky love
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Falling outr of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love is worst
Empty promises will wear
I know I know
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to easy
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof top
Write is on the sky love
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Ooh impossible(yeah yeah)
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof top
Write it on the sky love
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy(I was happy)
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

 No.15 Need You Now
by Lady Antebellum

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause, I can't fight is any more
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
Oh...
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk, and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh baby I need you now

 No.16 Hello
by Adele Adkins

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a different between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened
It's no secret
That the both of us are running out of time
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
I'm sorry
for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
but it won't
anymore
anymore
anymore
Hello from the outside
I must've called a thousand times
to tell you
I'm sorry
for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

No.17 Faded
by Conor Maynard Cover

You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us, Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Was is all in my fantasy
Where are you now
Were you only imaginary

Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded yeah
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost. I'm faded

And every single night I'm with a different girl
Who would've knew that life could be a lonely world?
I'm reminiscing, missing everything we were
So I could be with you, but I still think of her
It's crazy how we don't even talk
And I still think of you in every place that I walk
In my home, in my city, I guess you left a mark
Ain't it funny how you miss the brightest times when it's dark?
But the love of my life just turned into anonymous
So now you're a stranger that I don't wanna miss
A stranger with allher clothes in my laundry bin
All of her dresses, sweaters and cardigans
I should throw them out I should just forget it
The past can only hurt you if you let it
But I let it, cause I'm still about you
Lift is fucking crazy but it's crazier without you

Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded yeah
Faded, faded, I'm so faded
Faded, I'm so faded
Faded, faded, faded, faded, yeah

No.18 Enchanted
by Owl City
There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Wall of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wondered till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say,
Hey it was enchanting to meet you
Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts willl echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you too
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'm spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
Taylor I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

I was never in love with someone else
I never had somebody waiting on me
Cause you were all of my dreams come true
And I just wish you knew
Taylor I was so in love with you.

 No. 18 I Will Always Love You
 by Whitney Houston

If I should stay, I'll only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know I'll
Think of you every step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
You, my daring you, hmmm

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm talking with me
So, goodbye
Please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need
And I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you, joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you
You, darling, I love you
Oh, I'll always, I'll always love you

Love Story

Tayor Swift

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd and say hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staricase, begging you please don't go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes


So I sneak out to garden to see you
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh, oh
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me, I was begging you please don't go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes

Romeo save me they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes

Oh, oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me Juliet never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say yes
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Cause we were both young when I first saw you.

 Hero
 
Enrique Iglesias

Let me be your hero.
Would you dance,
If I asked you to dance?
Would you run,
And never look back?
Would you cry,
If you saw me crying?
And would you save my soul, tonight?
Would you tremble,
If I touched your lips?
Would you laugh?
Oh please tell me this.
Now would you die,
For the one you love?
Hold me in your arms, tonight.
I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.
Would you swear,
That you'll always be mine?
Or would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
I don't care...
You're here, tonight.
I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.
Oh, I just wanted to hold you.
Oh yeah.
Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
Well I don't care...
You're here, tonight.
I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain oh yeah.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.
I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
And I will stand by you, forever.
You can take my breath away.
You can take my breath away.
I can be your hero.

Coming Home

Skylar Grey

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming hoe
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the wolrd that I'm coming home.
